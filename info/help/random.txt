the `/random` command gets a random post from e621 after applying your preferred and search tags

in order to do this, first your preferred tags will be applied, then the tags from your query will be applied
certain tags will always be applied after the query to dramatically reduce the amount of inappropriate content one might find in a context

in SFW channels, the tag set `rating:s -rating:e -rating:q` is added on to every request, regardless of the tags you list; this is because it is not possible to spoil non-uploaded attachments, or images for embeds

in NSFW channels, a few other tags will be barred from results

in DMs, there are no required tags; know that this is a double-edged sword, and that you'll need to exclude *all* tags you don't wish to see
